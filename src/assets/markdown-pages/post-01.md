# What is a Gibibyte?
## The cloud computing unit of measure for storage space

If you have ever read the docs for a cloud service provider or clicked around on a IaaS dashboard, you may have seen the term 'gibibyte' or it's acronym, GiB, and wondered if it was a typo.  Well, it wasn't a typo, you read it correctly, it said gibibyte.
</p>
<p>
So, what exactly is a gibibyte?  It's pretty simple really, it just means a full gigabyte of cloud storage space.
</p>
<p>
Wait, doesn't that mean that a gibibyte is the same thing as a gigabyte? Not exactly.
</p>
<p>
Here's an example...when you have a storage device, like a computer hard drive or a usb memory stick, it has a capacity in gigabytes.  However, the storage drive always needs a small amount of space for it's own disk utilities and configuration files, so you can never use that full storage capacity.  Thus, a 32 GB usb thumb drive doesn't actually allow you to store a full 32 GB of your own data.  However, with cloud computing, the disk utilities and configurations are handled by a shared service.  Each cloud storage container doesn't need it's own utilities so you are actually getting just a little bit more storage space.  A 32 GiB cloud storage container will let you store a full 32 GB of your own data, while a 32 GB thumb drive will only let you store about 31.95 GB.

For larger applications and services with lots of media and content files, this savings can add up.  Although, for most applications this small savings won't make much of a difference, and you can probably think of the two as  being the same thing.
